Finished reading "Walkabout" by James Vance Marshall today. It's such a beautiful story of a lost Eden. I was intrigued about the book after watching its 1971 film adaptation by the same name which, even though it follows a slightly different plotline, is as beautiful as the source material. It narrates the story of Mary and Peter, two children stranded in the Australian desert following a plane crash, surviving the unforgiving territory with the help of an aboriginal guy who is on his rite of passage. One might tend to think that the author tends to idealise the tribal life, but that's an easy mistake to make: he doesn't turn a blind eye to its harsh realities – illnesses, ruthlessness, misogyny, ignorance, unpredictability, vulnerability – in contrast with the civilised world, even as he establishes how estranged the modern life has made us from our roots. The climactic part of the story that takes place towards the end of the book is almost dream-like in nature. And I don't even know how much of Biblical parallels are there, starting with the names of the children, to the stream and the forest, to the third day when Mary loses her final shred of inhibition and worldliness. The British Film Institute has included the film adaptation in their list of the "50 films you should see by the age of 14" – and I'd say the book deserves a place in the "50 books you should read by the age of 14" list, if there is one.
